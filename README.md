 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon Jobs Dataset

Introduction

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Amazon jobs dataset. We use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to clean, visualize, and gain insights from the data. This README will guide you through the setup, analysis, and further steps you can take to extend the project.

Dataset

The dataset contains information about various job postings by Amazon. The columns include job title, location, date posted, job description, and more. The data helps in understanding the hiring trends, popular job roles, and geographical distribution of jobs.

 Requirements

To run the analysis, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

 Analysis

1. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values
- Correct data types
- Remove duplicates

 2. Data Exploration
- Summary statistics of numerical columns
- Distribution of categorical variables
- Correlation matrix for numerical features

 3. Visualization
- Bar plots for categorical data
- Box plots to detect outliers
- Scatter plots to observe relationships between variables

Further Analysis Using Machine Learning

1. Predictive Analysis
- Job Posting Trends: Use time series analysis to predict future job postings.
- Job Role Classification: Build a classification model to predict the job role based on the job description.

2. Clustering
- Location-Based Clustering: Use clustering algorithms like K-Means to group job postings by location and identify hotspots.

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Job Description Analysis: Use NLP techniques to extract key skills and qualifications from job descriptions.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of job descriptions to understand the tone of the postings.

Tools for Advanced Analysis

1. Machine Learning Libraries
- scikit-learn: For building predictive models and performing clustering.
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: For advanced deep learning models.

2. NLP Libraries
- NLTK: For basic NLP tasks.
- spaCy: For more advanced NLP tasks.

3. Visualization Libraries
- seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations.
- plotly: For interactive plots.

4. Data Manipulation
- dask: For handling large datasets that do not fit into memory.
- SQL: For querying large datasets efficiently.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for performing EDA on the Amazon jobs dataset. By extending the analysis with ML and other tools, we can gain deeper insights and build predictive models to assist in strategic decision-making.
